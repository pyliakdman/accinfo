# accinfo

It is a simple JavaScript code snippet that you can use to display your GitHub account information using GitHub's REST API. This code fetches data from your GitHub account and displays basic information like your username, profile picture, and the number of public repositories we have.

Remember to replace "your_github_username" with your actual GitHub username. This code will display your username, profile picture, and the number of public repositories on a simple HTML page. You can then host this page on any web server, and when someone visits the page, they'll see your GitHub account information.
